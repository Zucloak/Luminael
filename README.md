# Luminael

Luminael is an AI-powered, decentralized, universal learning application. I designed it to return power and control to the individual learner.

Its architecture is its philosophy: by operating fully client-side with a zero-database, zero-backend model, Luminael ensures that user data is never collected, stored, or monetized by the application. The platform's novel Bring-Your-Own-API-Key (BYO-API) model is the cornerstone of this approach, empowering users to leverage the power of large language models for personalized education while maintaining absolute control over their data and API usage.

To get started with development or understanding the project structure, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx` and other files within the `src` directory.
