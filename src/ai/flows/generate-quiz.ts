**Key Concepts:**
${context}

ULTRA-CRITICAL RULE #0: ALL MATH MUST BE WRAPPED IN DOLLAR SIGNS! For EVERY piece of mathematical notation, variable, formula, number, or expression (e.g., \`q_1 = 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ C}\`, \`5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ C}\`, \`x^2\`, \`v_final\`), it MUST be enclosed in appropriate LaTeX dollar sign delimiters. This applies to question text, all multiple-choice options, and all parts of answers. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Inline Math: Use SINGLE dollar signs: \`\\$...\\$\`.
  CORRECT Example for your output: \`\\$(q_1 = 2 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\text{ C})\\$\`
  CORRECT Example for your output: \`A charge of \\$(5 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\text{ C})\\$ is moved...\`
  CORRECT Example for your output: \`...electric field of strength \\$(10^4 \\\\text{ N/C})\\$... \`
  INCORRECT (MISSING DOLLAR SIGNS!): \`(q_1 = 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ C})\`
- Display Math: Use DOUBLE dollar signs: \`\\$\\$...\\$\\$\`.
FAILURE TO WRAP ALL MATH IN DOLLAR SIGNS WILL RESULT IN UNRENDERED TEXT AND IS A CRITICAL ERROR.

**ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES FOR THIS TASK (Problem Solving Questions ONLY):**
1.  **ONLY 'problemSolving' Questions**: Every single question you generate MUST be a procedural, computation-based problem that requires a step-by-step derivation to reach a numeric or symbolic answer. Each question's \`questionType\` field MUST be set to exactly \`problemSolving\`.
2.  **STRICT Schema Adherence**: Each generated question object MUST strictly conform to the ProblemSolvingQuestionSchema: \`{ questionType: 'problemSolving', question: string, answer: string (detailed step-by-step solution, ideally with a \\\\boxed{final_answer}) }\`.
3.  **NO OTHER QUESTION TYPES**: Under NO circumstances are you to generate any \`multipleChoice\` questions or any \`openEnded\` (conceptual, theoretical, discussion-based) questions. Your output MUST NOT contain \`options\` fields (which belong to \`multipleChoice\`) or questions that ask for explanations or opinions. If the Key Concepts do not lend themselves to ${numQuestions} distinct calculative problems, generate as many as possible up to ${numQuestions}, but DO NOT substitute with other types.
4.  **Content Adherence**: All questions and solutions MUST be directly derived from the provided Key Concepts. No external knowledge.
5.  **Language**: The entire quiz MUST be in the same language as the Key Concepts.
6.  **Number of Questions**: Generate up to ${numQuestions} questions as specified. If fewer calculative problems can be derived, that is acceptable.
7.  **CRITICAL GLOBAL DE-DUPLICATION:** The provided list of \`existingQuestions\` contains titles of ALL previously generated questions in this entire session, regardless of their type. You ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT generate any question (for any format) whose core concept, topic, or specific calculation is substantially similar to ANY question title found in this \`existingQuestions\` list. Ensure maximum diversity and rigorously avoid all forms of repetition. Identical or near-identical questions are unacceptable and a failure.
8.  **Difficulty**: Calibrate questions to a '${difficulty}' level.
9.  **Impeccable and Robust LaTeX Formatting (RECALL CRITICAL RULE #0 ON WRAPPING ALL MATH IN DOLLAR SIGNS):**
    *   MANDATORY DELIMITERS (Rule #0 REITERATED): ALL math expressions, variables, and symbols (e.g., \`x\`, \`a^2\`, \`(a^2-x^2)\`) MUST be enclosed in \`\\$...\\$\` (inline) or \`\\$\\$...\\$\\$\` (display). This applies to the question text, AND for \`multipleChoice\` questions, it also applies to EACH of the options. For \`openEnded\` questions, this applies to the question text and the example answer/discussion points.
    *   Using \`\\\\text\` for Units/Annotations: When using \`\\\\text{...}\` for units or text within a mathematical formula, the ENTIRE formula, including the \`\\\\text{...}\` portion, MUST be enclosed within a single pair of LaTeX dollar-sign delimiters (as shown in CRITICAL RULE #0 examples).
    *   Enclose inline math with single dollar signs (\`\\$...\\$\`). Example: For 'the value is x squared units', output: The value is \\$x^{2}\\$ units.
    *   Enclose block/display math with double dollar signs (\`\\$\\$...\\$\\$\`). Example: \`\\$\\$ E = mc^{2} \\$\\$\`
    *   CRITICAL FOR SUPERSCRIPTS/SUBSCRIPTS: ALWAYS use curly braces for scripts, even for single characters. Examples: \`\\$x^{y}\\$\`, \`\\$a_{b}\\$\`, \`\\$10^{-19}\\$\`, \`\\$z^{6}\\$\`. Incorrect: \`\\$x^y\\$\`, \`\\$a_b\\$\`.
    *   Standard Commands: Use standard LaTeX commands (e.g., \`\\\\sin\`, \`\\\\cos\`, \`\\\\frac{}{}\`, \`\\\\sqrt{}\`, \`\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\`, \`\\\\int_{a}^{b}\`, \`\\\\vec{F}\`, \`\\\\alpha\`, \`\\\\beta\`, \`\\\\Delta\`). For example, write \`\\$x = a \\\\sin \\theta\\$\` instead of \`x = a sin Î¸\`.
    *   Escaping Special LaTeX Characters: If characters like \`#\`, \`_\`, \`^\`, \`{\`, \`}\` are needed as literal text *within* a math environment, they might need escaping (e.g., \`\\\\_\`, \`\\\\{\`). However, for math symbols, use LaTeX commands.
    *   Clarity for Renderer: Ensure there are no ambiguous constructions. For instance, make sure fractions are clearly denoted \`\\\\frac{numerator}{denominator}\`. Ensure matrices or multi-line equations use appropriate LaTeX environments (e.g., \`pmatrix\`, \`align\`, \`cases\`).
    *   DO NOT use Markdown for math. Only use LaTeX within dollar signs.
    *   DO NOT use non-standard or custom LaTeX commands.
    *   DO NOT use parentheses for math delimiters like \`\\(\` or \`\\)\`. Only use dollar signs.
    *   Test your LaTeX output mentally: Ensure every mathematical element is correctly delimited per CRITICAL RULE #0.

**Output Format Mandate:**
You MUST provide your response as a JSON object that strictly conforms to the GenerateQuizOutputSchema, containing a 'quiz' object, which in turn contains a 'questions' array. EACH question object in this array MUST be a ProblemSolvingQuestionSchema object.

FAILURE TO WRAP ALL MATH IN DOLLAR SIGNS WILL RESULT IN UNRENDERED TEXT AND IS A CRITICAL ERROR.

**NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (for 'multipleChoice', 'openEnded', 'mixed' formats):**
1.  **Strictly Adhere to Content:** You are strictly forbidden from using any external knowledge. All questions, options, and answers MUST be directly derived from the Key Concepts provided.
2.  **Obey the Language:** The entire quiz MUST be in the same language as the Key Concepts.
3.  **Generate Exactly ${numQuestions} Questions:** You are required to generate exactly the number of questions requested.
4.  **Strict Question Format Adherence & Type Integrity:**
    *   **If '${questionFormat}' is 'multipleChoice'**:
        *   Generate **ONLY** multiple-choice questions. Each question MUST have its \`questionType\` field set to exactly \`multipleChoice\`.
        *   Provide 4 distinct options. The \`answer\` field must exactly match one of the \`options\`.
        *   Output JSON for these questions MUST conform to the MultipleChoiceQuestionSchema.
        *   **ABSOLUTE CRITICAL DIRECTIVE for 'multipleChoice' format**: Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to generate any \`problemSolving\` questions or any \`openEnded\` (conceptual, theoretical, discussion-based) questions when '${questionFormat}' is 'multipleChoice'. Your output MUST NOT contain detailed step-by-step solutions for calculations (which belong to \`problemSolving\`) or ask for explanations/opinions (which belong to \`openEnded\`). Failure to adhere to this strict exclusivity for 'multipleChoice' format questions will render the output unusable. You must focus entirely and exclusively on multiple-choice questions that fit the MultipleChoiceQuestionSchema.
    *   **If '${questionFormat}' is 'openEnded'**:
        *   Generate **ONLY** theoretical, opinion-based, or conceptual questions. Each question MUST have its \`questionType\` field set to exactly \`openEnded\`.
        *   These questions require free-form, textual answers. The \`answer\` field should provide a model answer or key discussion points.
        *   **ABSOLUTE CRITICAL DIRECTIVE for 'openEnded' format**: Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to generate any \`multipleChoice\` questions or any \`problemSolving\` (calculative) questions when '${questionFormat}' is 'openEnded'. Your output MUST NOT contain \`options\` fields (which belong to \`multipleChoice\`) or present problems that require a definitive numeric/symbolic calculative answer (which belong to \`problemSolving\`). Failure to adhere to this strict exclusivity for 'openEnded' format questions will render the output unusable. Focus exclusively on conceptual, theoretical, or opinion-based questions requiring textual, explanatory answers. Output JSON for these questions MUST conform to the OpenEndedQuestionSchema.
    *   **If '${questionFormat}' is 'mixed'**:
        *   Generate a balanced blend of \`multipleChoice\`, \`problemSolving\` (calculative, as defined below), and \`openEnded\` (conceptual, as defined above) questions.
        *   Ensure each question generated correctly sets its \`questionType\` field and conforms to its respective schema (MultipleChoiceQuestionSchema, ProblemSolvingQuestionSchema, or OpenEndedQuestionSchema).
        *   For 'problemSolving' questions within mixed mode: They MUST be procedural, computation-based problems requiring a step-by-step derivation leading to a specific numeric or symbolic answer. The \`answer\` field MUST contain a detailed, step-by-step solution. The final answer in the solution should ideally be boxed (e.g., using \`\\\\boxed{answer}\`).
    *   **Universal Type Integrity**: Do not misclassify question types. For example, a question asking for an explanation of a concept is \`openEnded\`. A question requiring a calculation is \`problemSolving\`. Adhere strictly to the definitions.

5.  **Schema Adherence & No Garbage:** All fields (\`question\`, \`options\` (if applicable), \`answer\`, \`questionType\`) MUST contain meaningful, relevant content derived ONLY from the provided Key Concepts. Do not use generic placeholders. For multiple-choice questions, all four options must be distinct and plausible. Ensure every generated question object perfectly matches its corresponding schema (MultipleChoiceQuestionSchema, ProblemSolvingQuestionSchema, or OpenEndedQuestionSchema) based on its \`questionType\`.
6.  **Difficulty:** Calibrate the questions to a '${difficulty}' level.
7.  **CRITICAL GLOBAL DE-DUPLICATION:** The provided list of \`existingQuestions\` contains titles of ALL previously generated questions in this entire session, regardless of their type. You ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT generate any question (for any format) whose core concept, topic, or specific calculation is substantially similar to ANY question title found in this \`existingQuestions\` list.
