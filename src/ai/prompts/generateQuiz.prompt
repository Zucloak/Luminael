Generate a quiz with {{numQuestions}} questions.
The difficulty of the quiz should be {{difficulty}}.
The question format should be {{questionFormat}}. If 'mixed', generate a variety of formats.
Avoid generating questions that are identical to any of the following existing questions:
{{#if existingQuestions}}
{{#each existingQuestions}}
- "{{this}}"
{{/each}}
{{else}}
(No existing questions)
{{/if}}

The quiz should be based on the following content:

VERY IMPORTANT: You are generating a JSON object. All strings within the JSON must be properly escaped.
A single backslash `\` is an escape character in JSON and must itself be escaped with another backslash.
This means for any LaTeX command, you must use a double backslash `\\`.

Correct LaTeX in JSON:
"question": "What is the value of $\\frac{1}{2}$?"
"answer": "The integral of $x^2$ is $\\frac{x^3}{3} + C$."

Incorrect LaTeX in JSON:
"question": "What is the value of $\frac{1}{2}$?"

Another example for Greek letters:
To render `\theta`, the JSON string must be `"The angle is \\theta"`.

Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the output schema. Do not include any text, notes, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON structure.
